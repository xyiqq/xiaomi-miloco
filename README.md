**Xiaomi Local Copilot** is a future exploration solution for smart homes. Using Xiaomi Home cameras as the source of visual information and a self-developed LLM as its core, it connects all IoT devices throughout the house. Based on the development paradigm of LLM, it enables users to define various family needs and rules in natural language, achieving broader and more creative smart device integration.

## Blog

To help users gain a deeper understanding of the new features in this project, I have created a dedicated column for introduction:

👉 **[AI Technical Column - Xiaomi Miloco Blog](https://blog.csdn.net/h893529689/category_12799372.html)**

## Key Features

1. New Interaction Paradigm: Based on the development paradigm of LLM, rule-setting and complex device command control can be completed through natural language interaction.
2. On-Device LLM: The home scene tasks are split into two stages: planning and visual understanding. It provides Xiaomi's self-developed on-device model[Xiaomi MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B](https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco)to realize on-device video understanding and ensure family privacy and security.
3. New Use for Visual Data: Using camera data streams as a source of perceptual information, the LLM is used to analyze various home scene events contained in the visual data to respond to user queries.
4. Xiaomi Home Ecosystem: It connects with the Xiaomi Home ecosystem, supports the retrieval and execution of Mi Home devices and scenes, and supports sending customized content for Xiao Home notifications.
